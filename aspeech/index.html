            These are only examples of the prospective videos, but please take a modest setup under your circumstance. <br>If possible, please prioritize your audio quality, i.e to minumize the environment sound.
            <br><br>
            Please make an audio-visual recording of you reading the following paragraphs, maybe you want to go through them before make the video setup. <br>You can make a separate video for each paragraph, and try to live the words when you read them (s-l-o-w-i-n-g d-o-w-n would help). Integrity is the key.
            <br><br>
            I'm flattered to have you here, please don't bother editing your video, and it's okay to have some verbal improvisations, as long as you feel comfortable sending it to <a href="mailto:mianwei.wang@yale.edu">mianwei.wang@yale.edu</a>

Humans are so eloquent, but yet we are so miserable to talk. <br>
The speech comes from my mind to my mouth, and once the word comes to the world, it will begin to be withered.

        Would you understand the word "agreement"? Then I assume you agree with me on the meaning of "agreement", as language is a whole set of agreements. Will you agree?
<!-- Language is an agreement. Once you understand what I mean by the word “agreement”, you agreed with me on what I mean by “agreement”. 
So, when I talk, you agree. -->

You don’t have to know who he is, because neither do I. But it does not matter, because words do never matter, right? As long as I am talking here, the lines will bear me as the meaning.

        Oh, do you speak English? or Leng-ish, sheg-lin, Genshli, Lig-shen. <br>
Orthography is weird. Why do you have this circle become an “o”? and why a vertical line become the “l”? Oh, because you write it down to capture the phonetics? is writing a phonetic drawing?

        You know, these letters I print across the page, the scratches and scrawls you now focus upon, across the white surface, are hardly different from the footprints of ancient preys left in the snow, or even from the urine stains left by the dog.
        We read these traces, like our tribal ancestors, picking up the trail whenever it leaves off. Because we want to be meeting.
        <!-- , hunting the meaning and seizing the meeting. -->
        <!-- We read these traces with organs honed over millennia by our tribal ancestors, picking up the trail afresh whenever it leaves off, hunting the meaning, which actually is a meeting. -->

        Well, it seems frustrating we are still here, in the web of words and it didn’t direct us to anywhere else. What is caught in this web? Is there even a way to penetrate through it? Or does the speech, have only to be the speech?
