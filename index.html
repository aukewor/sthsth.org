        <div class="info">
            Dear visitor,
            <br><br>
            How are you? I’m so happy to see you here. This is a current placeholder for a publishing unit that is in the pipeline.
            Many things are uncertain at this point, but one is confirmed: a place for nourishing all kinds of creativities,
            active or passive, participatory or autonomous, remix or orginal, digital or physical.
            <br><br>
            When I found out that ISBN is the fact of free speech in most countries,
            I suddenly realized that why bookstores are wore off from Chinese markets. The market only distributes a fixed amount of ISBNs every year to a relatively fixed community of authorized publishers. So there is no such thing of writers can talk over the publishers, but creators beg to distribute their works and ideas into the public space. By the time when I worked with a
            contemporary gallery to publish a book in Beijing, it almost took the editor a year to get the book checked
            from the authorities, and though all the editing and design works were finished, we couldn’t get the book to
            print but prolonged waiting for that ISBN.
            <br><br>
            So it’s surprising for me that ISBN is purchaseable in markets out there, the symbolic string of digits that
            could represent the individual autonomy for creativity as well as communication. You still need to pay for
            the International Standard Book Number in the U.S., but guess what, that’s the ticket for all of us to join
            in this huge pool of entire human heritage.
            <br><br>
            I really hope to see you again, soon. And write me back if you’d be ever interested in publishing any of
            your works. Let’s get some of those non-sense digits!
            <br><br>
