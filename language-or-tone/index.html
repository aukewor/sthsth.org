      <p>Language or Tone?</p>

            If language is used as a form, removed of semantics, can we call the process restoration? <br><br>
            Can we discuss the language without discussing words? Can we discuss the language witshout discussing semantics? What had human language been before we had words? What is the language of animals?
          <br> <br>
            	What about the objects? Does the object talk? does the object have a language? Human's visible light spectrum is very narrow, it narrowed our recognition about the world surrounded—If you insist receiving the world by visual communication—There are still infrared ray, night vision, and James Turrell's monochrome rooms.
          <br> <br>
            	But our recognition of real objects is inseparable from its vibration, gravitation. The vibration indicates the internal molecular structure of the substance by transmitting and echoing itself outward. A classroom has a tone, a square has a tone. Walls, bricks, floors, grounds, the molecular structures of different materials mutter in different tones.
          <br> <br>
            	Can I make a project called LANGUAGE, including human language, animal language, and the language of exclusive substance as objects?
          <br> <br>
            	The human body is substance as an object, and humans also have language as animals. These are nested categories. The human body acts as an acoustic generator/instrument, but it happens that this instrument has the spinal cords and the brain.
          <br> <br>
            	Or should I call it TONE?
