        “Foley is the reproduction of everyday sound effects that are added to films, videos, and other media in post-production to enhance audio quality.
…The best Foley art is so well integrated into a film that it goes unnoticed by the audience. It helps to create a sense of reality within a scene.” <br>
—Wikipedia <i>Foley</i> <br>
<br>
The idea about foley is one how the best work is to have no work, no trace and no deliberateness except for mimicry of what is perceived by the audience as “reality”. The notion of “reality” in the acoustic field is sensed and formed by the physical world out there, again, the world built of wood, metal, rubber, air, flesh. The different molecular structures reflect different sound, the medium that delivers, the mass that contains, how much movement has been done, all they stay with Newton’s law and then define how the sound is sounded to us.  <br>
But what borders on farce about foley, always is the process behind the scene, the unexpected material and tricks people use. Here are some “Common tricks” listed on the Wikipedia page.
<br><br>
<i>
	Corn starch in a leather pouch makes the sound of snow crunching.<br>
	A pair of gloves sounds like bird wings flapping.<br>
	An arrow or thin stick makes a whoosh.<br>
	An old chair makes a controllable creaking sound.<br>
	A water-soaked rusty hinge when placed against different surfaces makes a creaking sound. Different surfaces change the sound considerably.<br>
	A heavy staple gun combined with other small metal sounds makes good gun noises.<br>
	…<br>

Not surprisingly, once those methods put in words, they come out as poems as if they just are. The discrepancy here reminds us of the juxtaposition of various things and metaphors put in poems, or we can say it the disjunction within the conjunction of words (things) there.  
Lyn Hejinian, the American poet, talks about how the relationship between language and things in the essay The Rejection of Closure. Related to the poem-like words of foley tricks, consider about “the fallacious comparison of words to world and delights in the ambiguity resulting from the discrepancy”, foley shows the same process of language doing of interpreting the outer world by building “the house of its consciousness.” The displacement between what things are and what things are perceived by us (even only acoustically) hence generates a gap, where on the two sides of the gap we can realize what we receiving from the world is not fully equal to the world itself.  <br><br>
Another interesting happening is introduced by Hejinian as defined delights, where she explains further that “we delight in our sensuous involvement with the materials of language, we long to join words to the world—to close the gap between ourselves and things”. The way she is reasoning here, a discourse in language aspect, articulates the impulsion on the relationship from us to the outer world, to things, to <i>Other</i>. Language works as the vehicle of interpretation, generated from our human selves, that works as critical mediums bridge us through to the outer physical world. The idea of foley art reveals a similarity here to the elaborated features of the language, as foley does it best to have the result of so-called “nature” or “reality” by enhancing the auditory experience, but all for reconstruction. The mirrored/interpreted from real-world becomes the dominant content of the whole, the most exquisite work generates from the one reveals the most naturality outside the body.
<br><br>
The reason of the delights generated from those interpretations, is because “we make”. Nomina sint numina is the notion that it’s nomina that plays the mirror of numina and becomes knowledge, where our whole intelligible civilazation holds. The simulacra shown in the mirror reflects what are the things like but also depending on the constituent material that we make of the mirror. What human empower themselves here, is to weave the mirror from the element level of metaphysical world that exists, also is comprehended in our own mind. We profoundly impact those “mirrors”—giving birth of the creations—because we can we make it up by making up the material of it: conceive it from the texture, structure and composition at the extremely microscopic level and hopefully even more and approaching infinite. The euphoria rising from creative activities comes from the the projection of ourselves through it. It is the bliss of newborns: We weave ourselves into the production when we are creating, as if they are the reproduction of ourselves.
<br><br>
On the other hand, the mirrored creations are the consummation between us and the outer surroundings, we are achieving the ultimate intimacy by giving a birth of the relationship. The tension of the enchanted intimacy so far has been congealed into an immortal avatar in case it fleets away in a real world.
