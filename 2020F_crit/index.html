            “Just as not all genes that can replicate do so successfully, so some memes are more successful in the meme-pool than others. This is the analogue of natural selection. I have mentioned particular examples of qualities that make for high survival value among memes. But in general they must be the same as those discussed for the replicators (genes): longevity, fecundity, and copying-fidelity.
            <br> ... <br>
                An “idea-meme” might be defined as an entity that is capable of being transmitted from one brain to another. The meme of Darwin's theory is therefore that essential basis of the idea which is held in common by all brains that understand the theory. The <i>differences</i>in the ways that people represent the theory are then, by definition, not part of the meme. If Darwin's theory can be subdivided into components, such that some people believe component A but not component B, while others believe B but not A, then A and B should be regarded as separate memes. If amlost everbody who believes in A also believes in B--if the memes are closely ‘linked’ to use thenetic term--then it is convenient to lump them together as one meme.”<br>

                The Jessi Slaughter Cyberbullying Controversy refers to series of abusive posts made toward Damien Leonhardt (formerly known as Jessica Leonhardt and the internet aliases Jessi Slaughter and KerliGirl13). At the age of 10, Leonhardt became a target of a massive 4chan raid in July 2010 after launching a public tirade against the image board community in a series of YouTube videos. At the time, many believed rumors that she was in a sexual relationship with Bood on the Dance Floor singer Dahvie Vanity (real name: Jesus David Torres). The feud quickly led to the creation of hundreds of image macros and remix videos mocking Jessica and her father, who later became involved in the drama, and prompted one of the first public discussions of cyberbullying as a serious issue in the news media.) </p>

The video was filmed at his high school studio, and he accidentally left the tape in a basement. It was taped over a portion of a basketball game (as seen extremely briefly at the end of the clip). The video was discovered by a schoolmate, whose friend created a computer file from the video tape. The video was distributed among the school's students. A student (Cory Homertziem) uploaded it to the Internet with the title Jackass_starwars_funny.wmv. The video eventually became a viral Internet meme through P2P services. According to court transcripts, the video first appeared on the Internet on the evening of April 14, 2003.)</p>

    <button type="button" class="collapsible">GIF Dithering</button>
    <div class="content">
        <div class="abstract">
            <p>GIF is palette-based: the colors used in an image (a frame) in the file have their RGB values defined in
                a palette table that can hold up to 256 entries, and the data for the image refer to the colors by their
                indices (0–255) in the palette table. The color definitions in the palette can be drawn from a color
                space of millions of shades (224 shades, 8 bits for each primary), but the maximum number of colors a
                frame can use is 256. This limitation seemed reasonable when GIF was developed because few people could
                afford the hardware to display more colors simultaneously. Simple graphics, line drawings, cartoons, and
                grey-scale photographs typically need fewer than 256 colors.</p>

                A digital camera can increase its sensitivity to light by amplifying the electronic signal; as a result,
                the higher the ISO sensitivity, the more obvious the effects of “noise” on your photographs.
            </p>
            <p>
                Image “noise”, resulted by some “unwanted signals” on digital cameras or sensors, is the inherent
                character of the electrical fluctuation—as long as there is electricity circuit running through. “Noise
                reduction” then, works in the process of examining the standing fluctuation in signals and weeding them
                off. It’s a most generic discriminator for handling digital images as one attempts to wipe out its
                intrinsic character of being an electronic.

    <button type="button" class="collapsible">This person doesnt exist in Human Phenotypes</button>
    <div class="content">
        <div class="abstract">
            <p>
                An organism’s phenotype results from two basic factors: the expression of an organism's genetic code, or
                its genotype, and the influence of environmental factors. Both factors may interact, further affecting
                phenotype.

            </p>
            <p>
                Geneticist Adam Rutherford wrote in his latest publication in mid 2020, the phrases we use to describe
                “race” today are poor scientific designations for the immense diversity within these billions of people.
                It is an irony that we roughly know what these descriptors mean colloquially while they are potentially
                incoherent in terms of scientific taxonomy.

            </p>
            <p>
                More often than not, the descriptor that stands for a group of people or a “race”, the naming and the
                capitalization it carries is deeply culturally described rather than scientific significance. Even the
                word “race” itself, the scientist had to use it in his book because of its public acceptance regardless
                of its scientific validity.
            </p>
            <p>
                The project here is not a move to reflect on the attitudes regarding the way capitalization--or lack
                thereof--on “race”, like the scientist does; rather, I invite you to take a quiet look at the miraculous
                diversity of organisms on the faces by taking them out from any established cultural envelopes, to purly
                consider
                how the human phenotype is shaped from the pathways of genetic codes and the influence of environmental
                factors.

    <div class="content">
        <div class="abstract">
            The Statute of Anne successfully reclaimed the identity and rights of authors in an early modern era, but
            also essentially divorced the author from the art work. Once the artwork is finished by the author’s hand,
            it slips into the frame of capitalization and marketization, with the publisher serving as the performative
            part of the copyright mechanism, one that serves for the registered axis of commodity exchange. From then
            on, the author as origin and ultimate owner of the text guards against the free will of the reader.
